  title={An open source perspective on AI and alignment with the EU AI Act},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence systems based on deep learning have increasingly received interest due to their success in complex human tasks. A current trend in deep learning is to study how algorithms learn multiple new abilities as their size and training data increase. "General purpose AI" (GPAI), that is systems that can transfer the acquired knowledge to solve multiple tasks, are candidate to constitute the backbone of many AI algorithms applied in specific fields on industry, e.g. healthcare, customer support, administration. While various research laboratories express safety concerns on GPAI and do not openly share access to their algorithms, others advocate for their "democratization" and an increasing amount of open-source versions is available online. In this study we analyze this phenomenon from two perspectives and try to reconcile them. From one side, research communities support open collaborations, free access to knowledge and resources; on the other, political institutions, involved in the orchestration between the support for innovation and the control of societal impact, aim at preventing violations of fundamental human rights. We particularly focus on the European approach for risk assessment of AI systems. In our opinion, it greatly overlaps with work in ethics and law conducted by AI researchers (e.g. the Stanford Centre for Research on Foundation Models). Specifically we identify some necessary modifications to improve coordination between the two sides, while also discussing viable implementations in the technical field.},

  abstract={The ability to understand how individuals perceive the world has an incoming great potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of models applied to thoughts recognition, and decoding tasks. I conducted experiments on four different datasets, each with multiple participants. Participants were asked to hear, see and feel stimuli while the Electrometer/MAG was recording brain activity. I filtered the raw signal in order to eliminate all possible noise and artefacts. When available, we incorporated subsidiary participants’ information such as age, gender, weight, and more relevant information. The analysis revealed that it is possible to perform thought recog- nition given the brain activity, with an accuracy average of over 93\%. The training objective leverages two tasks: classify the thought and regress the original channel-wise signal. Moreover, applying PCA and carrying the channels that contain 95\% of the variance. I considerably reduced the overall memory and computational overhead to exhibit comparable performances to the model without this trick. In conclusion, the study shows that the features space designed capture similarities between the subject responses to a given stimulus. The study shows the great potential of AI models able to learn a mapping between brain activity and internal thoughts. The results highlight the need for further research to optimize and assess long-term outcomes. Code: https://github.com/r1cc4r2o/DhW.},

  author={Tedoldi, Riccardo and De Rito, Carlo and Malatesta, Marco and Iotti, Eleonora and Dal Palù, Alessandro and Percudani, Riccardo},
  abstract={Neofunctionalization is a process by which a gene acquires a new function after a duplication event. The detection of neofunctionalization events is a challenging task, as it requires the comparison of the function of the ancestral gene with the function of the descendant genes. In this work, we propose a machine learning approach to detect neofunctionalization events. We use Transformer-based models to encode the protein sequences using different sources of information. We use a manually curated dataset, reaching an accuracy of 90\% in recognizing neofunctionalization events over the testset.},
