[PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439)


Hello! I am Riccardo Tedoldi, an Industrial PhD student at [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com) affiliated with [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en). I am currently working on structural-based ligand design under the supervision of [Prof. Patrick Bryant](https://patrickbryantlab.github.io/research.html), [Jon Paul Janet](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=-vwkQ3MAAAAJ&hl=en), [Alessandro Tibo](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?hl=en&user=0XBT4nwAAAAJ) and [Prof. Hossein Azizpour](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?hl=en&user=t6CRgJsAAAAJ). I am also interested in domain generalization of deep architectures and features compositionality. 

Genuine music enthusiast, I am currently learning how to play the piano. :)
